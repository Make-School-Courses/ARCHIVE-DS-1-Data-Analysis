## Course Description

Learn the foundational skills of data science, including data collection, scrubbing, analysis, and visualization with modern tools, libraries, and databases. Master the science and art of data exploration and visualization to tell stories with discoveries and persuade decision makers with data-driven insights. Collect a data set, explore, analyze, and visualize it to discover trends, then present insights to the class. Create and manage relational databases with SQL and document-based (NoSQL) databases, as well as gain an appreciation of the tradeoffs of both paradigms. Draw entity-relationship diagrams and connect entities with foreign keys and many-to-many relation tables. Balance minimizing redundancy with maximizing performance tradeoffs.
