DS1: Data Analysis, Databases, and Data Visualization

**_This repo is still under construction.  Things will be added and changed as the course progresses--check back often!_**

## Getting started

To make sure that you are prepared for the course, please follow the instructions found in the [Installation_Instructions.md](Installation_Instructions.md)

## Course Description

Learn the foundational skills of data science, including data collection, scrubbing, analysis, and visualization with modern tools, libraries, and databases. Master the science and art of data exploration and visualization to tell stories with discoveries and persuade decision makers with data-driven insights. Collect a data set, explore, analyze, and visualize it to discover trends, then present insights to the class. Create and manage relational databases with SQL and document-based (NoSQL) databases, as well as gain an appreciation of the tradeoffs of both paradigms. Draw entity-relationship diagrams and connect entities with foreign keys and many-to-many relation tables. Balance minimizing redundancy with maximizing performance tradeoffs.

## Learning Objective

1. Students can learn and do data pulling, data manipulation, data processing, data cleaning
2. Undestand data visulation for convey findings to non-experts
3. Apply statistical test to conclude about findings
4. A/B testing 
5. Analyse data statistically
6. Multiple hands on and projects in Python using packages such as Pandas, Matplotliob, Seaborn, Spicy.stats
